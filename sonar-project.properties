# SonarCloud seems to have little intelligence when it comes to code coverage.
# Quite simply if it sees a code file, it checks it against our coverage report
# and if not found flags it as uncovered. This also effects the overall coverage
# score. In our case this means SonarCloud is flagging everything under test/
# as lacking code coverage!
